![Image Horse](public/Rust-Wasm-Photo-Tool-App-June-2.webp)

**Live:** [rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app](https://rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **Batch Image Editor** for applying a logo to many photos in one pass, with a grid mosaic view of the gallery.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

- **[Service Workers & Caching](docs/Service-Workers-Caching.md)** — investigation: caching the WASM binary + app shell, the never-cache deny-list, and a phased PWA rollout.
- **[OpenRaster (.ora) Export/Import](docs/OpenRaster-Export-Import.md)** — plan for layered `.ora` interchange, grounded in the existing Rust layer API.
- **[Architecture Roadmap](docs/Architecture-Roadmap.md)** — the document-based-editor direction, prioritized and mapped onto the real repo (AppShell split, Zustand, workers, GPU).
- **[Security Hardening](docs/Security-Hardening.md)** — audit + roadmap: share-token CSPRNG, the image-upload firewall, EXIF-by-default, and the supervised items (CSP, COEP, encryption).

- **JSZip** — Client-side ZIP (batch export)
- **IndexedDB** — Local-first storage (originals, edits, gallery); **Dexie** content layer + Zustand persist adapter
- **Convex** — Real-time database + auth + serverless functions
- **Clerk** — Authentication (via `@convex-dev/auth`)
- **Stripe** — Payments / billing
- **Replicate** — AI image models (background removal, restore) via Convex

Latest release below. Full dated history → **[docs/Change-summary.md](docs/Change-summary.md)**.

### v5.9 — 2026-06-29

| # | Change | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **New-Document presets by use-case** — the Blank Canvas panel now has **Social / Web / Video / Paper** tabs, each offering ready sizes (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube thumbnail/banner, FHD/4K, A4/Letter, 4×6…). Pick a tab, pick a size, create. The logo/title is hidden while the panel is open for an uncluttered "New Document" view | Complete |
| 2 | **Canvas-on-import setting** — Settings → General → *Canvas on import* lets a freshly-opened photo land Photoshop-style on a slightly larger backing canvas as **two layers** (a Background canvas + the Photo on top), with a configurable border. Defaults to the classic single full-bleed layer (off). Backed by a new Rust `load_image_artboard` | Complete |
| 3 | **Lacey QC agent** — a committed `lacey` subagent that gates UI work by verifying every OK / Apply / Create / Save button is wired to a real handler and commits/closes as expected | Complete |

> **About this release — starting a canvas.** Two improvements to how an image session begins. The **Blank Canvas** panel is now organized by what you're making: a **Social / Web / Video / Paper** toggle swaps the offered sizes so a LinkedIn post, a YouTube thumbnail, or an A4 page is one click away — and the dialog drops its logo/title in that mode to give the setup the full panel. Separately, an opt-in **Canvas on import** preference loads a new photo onto a slightly larger backing canvas split into a *Background* and a *Photo* layer (Photoshop-style), so there's room to work around the image from the start; it's off by default, keeping the classic exact-size single-layer load. The two-layer artboard is rendered entirely in Rust (`load_image_artboard`) — the photo is pasted onto a transparent full-document layer over a solid canvas layer, with the photo layer active so the first edit targets the image.
