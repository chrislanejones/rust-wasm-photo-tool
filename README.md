**Live:** [rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app](https://rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **Batch Image Editor** for applying a logo to many photos in one pass, with a grid mosaic view of the gallery.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

### v7.26 — 2026-07-13

**Two decisions, one of which changes your exports.**

**Exports now include the Canvas by default.** If you import a photo with "Canvas on import" on (the default), your download now includes the padding and background colour you see on screen — what you see is what you get. Previously exports cropped to just the photo, on the theory that the backing canvas was "a compositional guide, not real content". That theory is retired: the Canvas is the document's bottom layer, so it ships. Turn it off in Settings ("Canvas background on export"), or X the layer out in the Layers panel. **This changes export output for existing users** — it is a deliberate reversal, not a regression.

**The Canvas is document metadata, not a logged pixel layer** (ADR-016, Draft). This one is invisible today and load-bearing tomorrow. The engine refuses to record an op log for any document with more than one layer — and *every* default import is two layers (Canvas fill + Photo). So op-log undo and its persistence, the work behind four ADRs and the v7.24 data-loss fixes, has been **dark by construction**: not switched off, structurally unreachable. ADR-016 settles the model that fixes it — the Canvas stays a layer you can see and toggle, but the log counts only *pixel* layers, so a default document becomes one pixel layer and the log activates. The engine work implementing it is in flight.

Also: the create dialog's **"Blank Canvas" is now "New Canvas"** — the word "Canvas" should mean exactly one thing.

**And the six-session ghost is dead.** The COOP/COEP cross-origin-isolation check (ADR-009) was finally run in a real browser, with a real sign-in: `crossOriginIsolated === true` both logged out *and* logged in, Clerk clean, no COEP/CORP errors. Isolation holds *through* the auth flow — the one thing a headless spike could only infer. That was the last blocker on WASM threading, so the rayon acceleration path for the magnetic lasso and Smart Brush (built scalar in v7.25 precisely because this was unverified) is now open. Residual, honestly recorded: the OAuth-popup path and the Convex WebSocket under isolation were not separately exercised, and both want a check before COOP headers ship to production.
