**Live:** [imagehorse.app](https://imagehorse.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Editor:** [edit.imagehorse.app](https://edit.imagehorse.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **batch editor** that works across a whole gallery in one pass — stamp a logo, apply text, bulk-rename by pattern, or name every photo from what is actually in it with a local describer that needs no account and no per-image cost.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

## Quick start

Needs Node + [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and the Rust toolchain plus
[`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) to build the engine.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build:wasm   # compile the Rust engine -> pkg/  (required before first run)
pnpm run dev          # editor at localhost:5173
```

`pnpm run build` bundles whatever is already in `pkg/` — it does **not** rebuild the
engine. After changing anything under `src/`, run `build:wasm` again, or use
`pnpm run build:all` to do both. A stale `pkg/` looks exactly like a broken feature.

Convex and Clerk are optional: with no keys set the app runs fully logged-out,
which is a supported path and not a degraded one. Full setup, deploy notes and
environment variables → **[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md)**.

## Documentation

- **[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md)** — install it, run the app and the marketing site, set up Convex, deploy.
- **[Architecture](docs/Architecture.md)** — how it fits together: layers and compositing, why one WASM binary, the Rust ↔ Convex bridge.
- **[File Map](docs/File-Map.md)** — where everything lives, in both the Rust crate (`src/`) and the React app (`app/src/`).
- **[Features](docs/Features.md)** — what it can actually do, end to end.
- **[Keyboard Shortcuts](docs/Keyboard-Shortcuts.md)** — every binding. The in-app modal (`Alt + /`) is authoritative for the tool digits; this mirrors it.
- **[OpenRaster (.ora)](docs/OpenRaster-Export-Import.md)** — layered interchange with Krita, GIMP and friends: how import/export work, and why this format.
- **[CI](docs/CI.md)** — the workflow jobs, the deploy sentinel, the static guardrails, and the local git hooks.
- **[Deploying](docs/Deploying.md)** — the two Vercel projects, the prerender step that makes the marketing site indexable, DNS, and the in-progress move of the editor off Netlify.
- **[Change Summary](docs/Change-summary.md)** — the full dated release history.

Design decisions live in **[docs/adr/](docs/adr/INDEX.md)**. Superseded investigations and planning notes are kept in **[docs/archive/](docs/archive/README.md)** rather than deleted — each one says what went stale about it.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust** — WASM processing layer (`wasm-bindgen`, `png` crate, `ab_glyph` fonts, SIMD128 kernels)
- **React 19** — UI framework (19.2.x, pinned through the pnpm catalog)
- **TypeScript** — Type safety
- **Zustand** — Client state management (UI / tool / gallery stores; IndexedDB-persisted prefs)
- **Vite** — Build tool with WASM support (`vite-plugin-wasm` + top-level await)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility styling via semantic design tokens; core utilities only, variants via cva
- **Radix UI** — Accessible primitives (Dialog, Tooltip, Context Menu)
- **Framer Motion** — Panel animations
- **Lucide React** — Icons
- **Sonner** — Toast notifications
- **emoji-mart** — Emoji picker (stamp tool)
- **JSZip** — Client-side ZIP (batch export)
- **IndexedDB** — Local-first storage (originals, edits, gallery); **Dexie** content layer + Zustand persist adapter
- **Convex** — Real-time database + auth + serverless functions
- **Clerk** — Authentication, wired to Convex through `ConvexProviderWithClerk` (`convex/react-clerk`)
- **Stripe** — Payments / billing, called over raw REST from Convex (no SDK dependency)
- **Replicate** — AI image models (background removal, restore) via Convex

## The marketing site

`marketing/` — the five-page site at **[imagehorse.app](https://imagehorse.app/)**:
home, architecture, features, pricing, trail log. Vite + React 19 + react-router,
plain CSS off the tokens in `src/tokens.css` (no Tailwind, no UI library).
Vercel builds it via the root `vercel.json` — **don't delete that file**, it's what
points the deploy at `marketing/dist` instead of the app.

```bash
pnpm run dev:marketing      # local
pnpm run build:marketing    # production → marketing/dist
node marketing/scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs   # refresh the derived data (see below)
```

Its numbers are derived, never typed. `src/data/commits.ts` (the Trail Log's
commit squares) and `src/data/features.ts` come from `git log` and
`docs/Features.md` via `scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs` — **run it on every release**,
or the graph quietly keeps drawing last month. `src/data/releases.ts` is the
changelog itself, so that one is hand-written: add the new release at the top.

## Changelog

Latest release below. Full dated history → **[docs/Change-summary.md](docs/Change-summary.md)**.

### v8.80 — 2026-09-20

**The font menu picks real fonts, object removal is a brush on the canvas, and an undo no longer comes back after a reload.**

The Text tool's font menu used to be decoration. `render_text` took no font at
all, so every choice drew the same face, and three different surfaces disagreed
about the result by as much as 26%. Liberation Sans, Serif and Mono now ship as
real files that load when you pick one. None of them went into the engine — they
are handed to it at runtime, so the menu can grow later without the download
growing with it.

Paying for that made the engine smaller, not bigger. The faces carry TrueType
hinting instructions, and the rasterizer has never run them. Stripping the dead
hinting gave back more than the three new families cost: **845,156 → 814,202
bytes**, 30,954 smaller than v8.79. A test fails on any face that arrives with
hinting still in it, so a routine font update cannot quietly spend those bytes
again.

Remove Object is a brush on the real image now, not a popup. You paint over the
thing you want gone, at whatever zoom you are on, and the app stays visible
behind the mask. The old popup painted on a private copy of the frame capped at
640 pixels wide — about a third of actual size — and you could not zoom or pan
while you worked. Undo Stroke takes back the last stroke; Clear Mask starts
over. The mask that goes to the server is byte-for-byte what it was.

Undo back to nothing used to come back. Apply an edit, press Ctrl+Z, reload, and
the change you had just discarded was there again — the autosave never wrote the
undo, so the archive on disk still held the old edit. That was silent data loss
and it was live.

The status bar says **Undo NN%** — how far undo can actually reach right now, as
a share of your History depth setting. It replaces the toast that appeared once
per photo to say undo was getting shallower. It is always there and it is never
red.

Shape sloppiness is a ramp instead of a switch. It went from computer-drawn to
hand-drawn with nothing in between, because three things jumped the moment the
slider left zero — and one of them was a real bug: the firm path drew a circle
and the sketchy path drew the bounding-box ellipse, so any non-square drag
changed shape *and* size at sloppiness 1. The fill had been sitting inside a
wider outline the whole time.

Phones can reach settings. A gear in the header opens a sheet with Theme and
Motion, so a phone is no longer stuck on whatever theme it booted with.

Signing in works against the production Clerk instance.

The site has a blog. The first post is about moving the engine into a worker,
and it has figures that move. There is an About page with real photos, the home
page tiles have names and a press you can feel, and the hero has a slider that
runs the edit backwards.
