**Live:** [rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app](https://rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **Batch Image Editor** for applying a logo to many photos in one pass, with a grid mosaic view of the gallery.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

## Changelog

Latest release below. Full dated history → **[docs/Change-summary.md](docs/Change-summary.md)**.

### v7.29 — 2026-07-13

**The pen tool's closed paths never closed.** You could draw a full circle, click back on the first anchor to close it, and get nothing — no stroke, no fill. The reason turned out to be a hit-test, not geometry: the first anchor's 8×8 handle sits *on top of* the canvas capture rect and stops the click from propagating, so the handler that implements "click the first anchor to close the path" never saw it. The path never committed, so nothing was ever drawn or filled. Closing now works where the click actually lands, and a closed path fills.

The engine was never at fault, and there are now two tests saying so: a hand-drawn circle whose last anchor misses the first by a couple of pixels **fills correctly**, because the fill wraps the contour. It never needed pixel-perfect clicking.

**Reselecting a pen path made it disappear.** Kind-7 Bézier paths fell through to the rectangle-bbox handler, which hid the baked path and drew a *rectangle* in its place. They now re-open in the pen overlay with their curve and control points, editable.

**The start page no longer claims you're using a tool.** Since v7.25 the address bar showed `#/tool/resize/compress` on a page with no image open — a tool you can't see, can't use, and whose link just drops the recipient back on the start screen. Routes describe a view *of an image*; with nothing open there's no view to address, so the URL stays clean and reappears when a photo loads.

**Tooltips rendered underneath the gallery.** Not a z-index problem, despite looking exactly like one: tooltips rendered *inline*, inside whatever panel they belonged to, and a panel is its own stacking context — so a `z-50` tooltip in the Tools panel still lost to the gallery. They now portal to the document body, where the z-index token means what it says. Raising the number would never have fixed it. This fixes every tooltip in the app.

**"Auto Compress" is now "Auto Compress & Resize"** — because that is what it does. Since v7.22 it also shrinks anything over 2500px on a side, and the old name hid a resize from the person clicking the button. The new lightbulb explains the ~200 KB target, the resize threshold, and the 1280px floor it will not shrink below.
