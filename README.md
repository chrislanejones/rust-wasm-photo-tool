![Image Horse](public/Rust-Wasm-Photo-Tool-App-June-2.webp)

**Live:** [rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app](https://rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **Batch Image Editor** for applying a logo to many photos in one pass, with a grid mosaic view of the gallery.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

## Documentation

- **[Architecture](docs/Architecture.md)** — system diagram, layers/compositing, the single-WASM-binary rationale, Rust ↔ Convex bridge.
- **[File Map](docs/File-Map.md)** — Rust module map (`src/`) and the React frontend structure (`app/src/`).
- **[Change Summary](docs/Change-summary.md)** — full dated release history (v2.1 → latest).
- **[Keyboard Shortcuts](docs/Keyboard-Shortcuts.md)** — every shortcut (tools, panels, transforms, zoom, gallery).
- **[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md)** — install, run the app + marketing site, Convex setup, deploy notes.
- **[Features](docs/Features.md)** — full feature list: Rust/WASM image processing + the React UI.
- **[GitHub Actions (CI)](docs/GitHub-Actions.md)** — the CI workflow jobs (build, security, audits) and Dependabot.
- **[CI Guardrails](docs/CI-Guardrails.md)** — the advisory `guardrails` job, flipping checks to blocking, and the local hook mirror.
- **[Refactor Playbook](docs/Refactor-Playbook.md)** — single-source-of-truth conventions (color / type / z-index tokens, React + Rust health, target folder structures) and the reusable guardrail bundle.
- **[State Management](docs/State-Management.md)** — the Zustand stores, the `SetArg` drop-in migration off AppShell's `useState`, and what stays local.
- **[IndexedDB Investigation](docs/IndexedDB-Investigation.md)** — why IndexedDB, the live content databases, the Zustand persist adapter, and the Dexie content layer.
- **[Service Workers & Caching](docs/Service-Workers-Caching.md)** — investigation: caching the WASM binary + app shell, the never-cache deny-list, and a phased PWA rollout.
- **[OpenRaster (.ora) Export/Import](docs/OpenRaster-Export-Import.md)** — plan for layered `.ora` interchange, grounded in the existing Rust layer API.
- **[Architecture Roadmap](docs/Architecture-Roadmap.md)** — the document-based-editor direction, prioritized and mapped onto the real repo (AppShell split, Zustand, workers, GPU).
- **[Security Hardening](docs/Security-Hardening.md)** — audit + roadmap: share-token CSPRNG, the image-upload firewall, EXIF-by-default, and the supervised items (CSP, COEP, encryption).

## Tech Stack

- **Rust** — WASM processing layer (`wasm-bindgen`, `png` crate, `ab_glyph` fonts, SIMD128 kernels)
- **React 19** — UI framework
- **TypeScript** — Type safety
- **Zustand** — Client state management (UI / tool / gallery stores; IndexedDB-persisted prefs)
- **Vite** — Build tool with WASM support (`vite-plugin-wasm` + top-level await)
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility styling (semantic design tokens)
- **Radix UI** — Accessible primitives (Dialog, Tooltip, Context Menu)
- **Framer Motion** — Panel animations
- **Lucide React** — Icons
- **Sonner** — Toast notifications
- **emoji-mart** — Emoji picker (stamp tool)
- **JSZip** — Client-side ZIP (batch export)
- **IndexedDB** — Local-first storage (originals, edits, gallery); **Dexie** content layer + Zustand persist adapter
- **Convex** — Real-time database + auth + serverless functions
- **Clerk** — Authentication (via `@convex-dev/auth`)
- **Stripe** — Payments / billing
- **Replicate** — AI image models (background removal, restore) via Convex

## The marketing site

`marketing/` — the five-page site at **[image-horse.vercel.app](https://image-horse.vercel.app/)**:
home, architecture, features, pricing, trail log. Vite + React 19 + react-router,
plain CSS off the tokens in `src/tokens.css` (no Tailwind, no UI library).
Vercel builds it via the root `vercel.json` — **don't delete that file**, it's what
points the deploy at `marketing/dist` instead of the app.

```bash
pnpm run dev:marketing      # local
pnpm run build:marketing    # production → marketing/dist
node marketing/scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs   # refresh the derived data (see below)
```

Its numbers are derived, never typed. `src/data/commits.ts` (the Trail Log's
commit squares) and `src/data/features.ts` come from `git log` and
`docs/Features.md` via `scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs` — **run it on every release**,
or the graph quietly keeps drawing last month. `src/data/releases.ts` is the
changelog itself, so that one is hand-written: add the new release at the top.

### v7.45 — 2026-07-24

**See what a selection will grab before you commit.** With the Select tool, hover over the image and hold a modifier: the region a click *would* select lights up as a filled zone — green while you hold Shift (what you'd add), red while you hold Alt (what you'd subtract). It re-floods live from the pixel under your cursor as you move. Click and it commits; the zone turns into the real marching ants. Let go of the key, or move off the image, and it clears. It's purely there to help you aim — nothing about it changes the picture or your selection.

It works for the wand, the edge-aware wand, and color range (the magnetic lasso is anchor-based, so it has no hover preview). The preview runs the exact same flood the real click runs — computed in the engine, read-only — so what you see is what you'll get, and it never touches your undo history.
