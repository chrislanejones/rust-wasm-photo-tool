**Live:** [rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app](https://rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **Batch Image Editor** for applying a logo to many photos in one pass, with a grid mosaic view of the gallery.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

## Documentation

- **[IndexedDB Investigation](docs/IndexedDB-Investigation.md)** — why IndexedDB, the live content databases, the Zustand persist adapter, and the Dexie content layer.
- **[Service Workers & Caching](docs/Service-Workers-Caching.md)** — investigation: caching the WASM binary + app shell, the never-cache deny-list, and a phased PWA rollout.
- **[OpenRaster (.ora) Export/Import](docs/OpenRaster-Export-Import.md)** — plan for layered `.ora` interchange, grounded in the existing Rust layer API.
- **[Architecture Roadmap](docs/Architecture-Roadmap.md)** — the document-based-editor direction, prioritized and mapped onto the real repo (AppShell split, Zustand, workers, GPU).
- **[Security Hardening](docs/Security-Hardening.md)** — audit + roadmap: share-token CSPRNG, the image-upload firewall, EXIF-by-default, and the supervised items (CSP, COEP, encryption).

- **Zustand** — Client state management (UI / tool / gallery stores; IndexedDB-persisted prefs)
- **Vite** — Build tool with WASM support (`vite-plugin-wasm` + top-level await)
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility styling (semantic design tokens)
- **Radix UI** — Accessible primitives (Dialog, Tooltip, Context Menu)
- **Framer Motion** — Panel animations
- **Lucide React** — Icons
- **Sonner** — Toast notifications
- **emoji-mart** — Emoji picker (stamp tool)
- **JSZip** — Client-side ZIP (batch export)
- **IndexedDB** — Local-first storage (originals, edits, gallery); **Dexie** content layer + Zustand persist adapter
- **Convex** — Real-time database + auth + serverless functions
- **Clerk** — Authentication (via `@convex-dev/auth`)
- **Stripe** — Payments / billing
- **Replicate** — AI image models (background removal, restore) via Convex

## The marketing site

`marketing/` — the five-page site at **[image-horse.vercel.app](https://image-horse.vercel.app/)**:
home, architecture, features, pricing, trail log. Vite + React 19 + react-router,
plain CSS off the tokens in `src/tokens.css` (no Tailwind, no UI library).
Vercel builds it via the root `vercel.json` — **don't delete that file**, it's what
points the deploy at `marketing/dist` instead of the app.

```bash
pnpm run dev:marketing      # local
pnpm run build:marketing    # production → marketing/dist
node marketing/scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs   # refresh the derived data (see below)
```

Its numbers are derived, never typed. `src/data/commits.ts` (the Trail Log's
commit squares) and `src/data/features.ts` come from `git log` and
`docs/Features.md` via `scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs` — **run it on every release**,
or the graph quietly keeps drawing last month. `src/data/releases.ts` is the
changelog itself, so that one is hand-written: add the new release at the top.

## Changelog

Latest release below. Full dated history → **[docs/Change-summary.md](docs/Change-summary.md)**.

### v7.53 — 2026-07-26

**The site says what it is in the tab, not just on the page.** The browser title
was "local-first image editing in the browser" — accurate and forgettable. It
now leads with the line the homepage already opens on.

**⌘K searches the features, not just the pages.** All 45 entries from the
Features page are in the palette, each one jumping to its own anchor rather than
the top of a long page. They come from the same generated list the page renders,
so a feature can't be in one and missing from the other.

**The feature list caught up with the toolbar.** Eight entries still described
the eleven-tool layout — "Effects → Color Picker tab", "the Arrows sub-tab
inside the Shapes tool" — none of which exist since the five groups landed.
They now name the sub-tool you'd actually click, and five new entries cover the
group toolbar, sub-tool routing and dispatch, the colour history, and OCR.

**Also in the editor:** Object Removal was unreachable. The AI panel used to
pick between its modes with its own tile row; that row moved into the sub-tool
header, and the restructure then filled the header with the group's sub-tools —
leaving nothing that could reach Object Removal. Background Removal and Object
Removal now sit together under one AI panel.

The top bar's buttons match the tool rail: same border, same hover ring, same
icon proportion. The panel toggles and the Review panel's section toggles are
one component and now look it.
