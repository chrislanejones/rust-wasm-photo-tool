**Live:** [rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app](https://rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **Batch Image Editor** for applying a logo to many photos in one pass, with a grid mosaic view of the gallery.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

Latest release below. Full dated history → **[docs/Change-summary.md](docs/Change-summary.md)**.

### v7.27 — 2026-07-13

**The op log wakes up on a normal photo.** This is the release that makes the last four ADRs' worth of work reachable, and it ships as an engine change nobody will see today.

The problem, stated bluntly: the engine refused to record an op log for any document with more than one layer — and *every* default import is two layers (the Canvas fill plus your photo). So op-log undo and its persistence weren't switched off, they were **structurally unreachable**. Turning the flag on would have shipped nothing to anyone.

ADR-016's fix is a reclassification, not a rewrite. The **Canvas is now document metadata**: still layer 0, still visible and toggleable in the Layers panel, but the log counts only *pixel* layers. A default document is therefore one pixel layer, and the log activates. No auto-flatten, no multi-layer op-log rewrite.

Underneath it, the engine stopped identifying the Canvas by the string `"Background"` — a name that, awkwardly, meant *the fill* in artboard mode and *the photo* everywhere else, and was checked in four places. It now carries an explicit `LayerKind`. A user renaming a layer "Background" was one step away from a silent wrong-document restore; that door is closed, and there's a test standing in it.

**The proof:** a default Canvas+Photo document now records **2 ops where it recorded 0**, and undo replays byte-identically through the log without flattening the stack. Two guards ride along — a genuine second content layer still leaves op-log scope (the log must never claim a document it can't replay), and *painting on the Canvas itself* leaves scope too, because the log's document is the content plane and recording that stroke would replay it onto your photo. Both fall back to snapshot undo rather than being silently wrong.

138 Rust tests (from 132), 123 in the frontend. The engine grew 448 bytes.

`ih_oplog_undo` and `ih_oplog_persist` still ship **OFF**. This release removes the blocker; it doesn't flip the switch. That comes after dogfooding — and now dogfooding will actually exercise something.
