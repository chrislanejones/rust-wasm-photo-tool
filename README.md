**Live:** [imagehorse.app](https://imagehorse.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Editor:** [edit.imagehorse.app](https://edit.imagehorse.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **batch editor** that works across a whole gallery in one pass — stamp a logo, apply text, bulk-rename by pattern, or name every photo from what is actually in it with a local describer that needs no account and no per-image cost.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

## Quick start

Needs Node + [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and the Rust toolchain plus
[`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) to build the engine.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build:wasm   # compile the Rust engine -> pkg/  (required before first run)
pnpm run dev          # editor at localhost:5173
```

`pnpm run build` bundles whatever is already in `pkg/` — it does **not** rebuild the
engine. After changing anything under `src/`, run `build:wasm` again, or use
`pnpm run build:all` to do both. A stale `pkg/` looks exactly like a broken feature.

Convex and Clerk are optional: with no keys set the app runs fully logged-out,
which is a supported path and not a degraded one. Full setup, deploy notes and
environment variables → **[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md)**.

## Documentation

- **[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md)** — install it, run the app and the marketing site, set up Convex, deploy.
- **[Architecture](docs/Architecture.md)** — how it fits together: layers and compositing, why one WASM binary, the Rust ↔ Convex bridge.
- **[File Map](docs/File-Map.md)** — where everything lives, in both the Rust crate (`src/`) and the React app (`app/src/`).
- **[Features](docs/Features.md)** — what it can actually do, end to end.
- **[Keyboard Shortcuts](docs/Keyboard-Shortcuts.md)** — every binding. The in-app modal (`Alt + /`) is authoritative for the tool digits; this mirrors it.
- **[OpenRaster (.ora)](docs/OpenRaster-Export-Import.md)** — layered interchange with Krita, GIMP and friends: how import/export work, and why this format.
- **[CI](docs/CI.md)** — the workflow jobs, the deploy sentinel, the static guardrails, and the local git hooks.
- **[Deploying](docs/Deploying.md)** — the two Vercel projects, the prerender step that makes the marketing site indexable, DNS, and the in-progress move of the editor off Netlify.
- **[Change Summary](docs/Change-summary.md)** — the full dated release history.

Design decisions live in **[docs/adr/](docs/adr/INDEX.md)**. Superseded investigations and planning notes are kept in **[docs/archive/](docs/archive/README.md)** rather than deleted — each one says what went stale about it.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust** — WASM processing layer (`wasm-bindgen`, `png` crate, `ab_glyph` fonts, SIMD128 kernels)
- **React 19** — UI framework (19.2.x, pinned through the pnpm catalog)
- **TypeScript** — Type safety
- **Zustand** — Client state management (UI / tool / gallery stores; IndexedDB-persisted prefs)
- **Vite** — Build tool with WASM support (`vite-plugin-wasm` + top-level await)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility styling via semantic design tokens; core utilities only, variants via cva
- **Radix UI** — Accessible primitives (Dialog, Tooltip, Context Menu)
- **Framer Motion** — Panel animations
- **Lucide React** — Icons
- **Sonner** — Toast notifications
- **emoji-mart** — Emoji picker (stamp tool)
- **JSZip** — Client-side ZIP (batch export)
- **IndexedDB** — Local-first storage (originals, edits, gallery); **Dexie** content layer + Zustand persist adapter
- **Convex** — Real-time database + auth + serverless functions
- **Clerk** — Authentication, wired to Convex through `ConvexProviderWithClerk` (`convex/react-clerk`)
- **Stripe** — Payments / billing, called over raw REST from Convex (no SDK dependency)
- **Replicate** — AI image models (background removal, restore) via Convex

## The marketing site

`marketing/` — the five-page site at **[imagehorse.app](https://imagehorse.app/)**:
home, architecture, features, pricing, trail log. Vite + React 19 + react-router,
plain CSS off the tokens in `src/tokens.css` (no Tailwind, no UI library).
Vercel builds it via the root `vercel.json` — **don't delete that file**, it's what
points the deploy at `marketing/dist` instead of the app.

```bash
pnpm run dev:marketing      # local
pnpm run build:marketing    # production → marketing/dist
node marketing/scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs   # refresh the derived data (see below)
```

Its numbers are derived, never typed. `src/data/commits.ts` (the Trail Log's
commit squares) and `src/data/features.ts` come from `git log` and
`docs/Features.md` via `scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs` — **run it on every release**,
or the graph quietly keeps drawing last month. `src/data/releases.ts` is the
changelog itself, so that one is hand-written: add the new release at the top.

## Changelog

Latest release below. Full dated history → **[docs/Change-summary.md](docs/Change-summary.md)**.

### v8.82 — 2026-09-21

**Text keeps its typeface and its box through a reload, and the pricing page stops selling two things that don't exist.**

A committed text box lost its typeface and its size on reload, and only on
reload. Pick Liberation Mono, commit, reload, and the words came back
proportional; Serif came back without its serifs. The box you dragged came back
at the default. It had been live since v8.80.

There were two losses, and either one was enough on its own. Replaying the undo
history treated a text edit as a replacement, so the typeface and the box fell
back to their defaults the moment an edit replayed. And the copy that saves your
work to this browser had never kept the box at all — the wrap width, box height
and perspective have been written by the engine since v8.40 and not one of them
had ever reached disk. Both halves are fixed, and the same latent bug in shape
edits is fixed with them. Saved work already on your disk comes back closer to
what you left, never further from it.

The pricing page stops selling two things that don't exist. Pro said "cloud
originals" and every tier said "projects". No tier uploads your originals — they
stay on your device — and there is no Projects screen. Both are gone, and the
page now says Pro's AI allowance is 50 a day and 300 a month, which is what the
server actually enforces.

The rest of the site caught up. The features page lists all twelve presets,
the three real typefaces, 38 sub-tools, H for pan and the Magic Eraser as
shipped. The two architecture diagrams agree with each other again. The blog
post's eight source links all went to a `main` branch this repo has never had;
they work now.

The engine grew by 230 bytes, to 814,432.
