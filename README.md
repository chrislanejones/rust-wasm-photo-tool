**Live:** [rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app](https://rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **Batch Image Editor** for applying a logo to many photos in one pass, with a grid mosaic view of the gallery.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

## Documentation

- **[Architecture](docs/Architecture.md)** — system diagram, layers/compositing, the single-WASM-binary rationale, Rust ↔ Convex bridge.
- **[File Map](docs/File-Map.md)** — Rust module map (`src/`) and the React frontend structure (`app/src/`).
- **[Change Summary](docs/Change-summary.md)** — full dated release history (v2.1 → latest).
- **[Keyboard Shortcuts](docs/Keyboard-Shortcuts.md)** — every shortcut (tools, panels, transforms, zoom, gallery). The in-app modal (`Alt + /`) is the source of truth; this mirrors it.
- **[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md)** — install, run the app + marketing site, Convex setup, deploy notes.
- **[Features](docs/Features.md)** — full feature list: Rust/WASM image processing + the React UI.
- **[GitHub Actions (CI)](docs/GitHub-Actions.md)** — the CI workflow jobs (build, security, audits) and Dependabot.
- **[CI Guardrails](docs/CI-Guardrails.md)** — the advisory `guardrails` job, flipping checks to blocking, and the local hook mirror.
- **[Refactor Playbook](docs/Refactor-Playbook.md)** — single-source-of-truth conventions (color / type / z-index tokens, React + Rust health, target folder structures) and the reusable guardrail bundle.
- **[State Management](docs/State-Management.md)** — the Zustand stores, the `SetArg` drop-in migration off AppShell's `useState`, and what stays local.
- **[IndexedDB Investigation](docs/IndexedDB-Investigation.md)** — why IndexedDB, the live content databases, the Zustand persist adapter, and the Dexie content layer.
- **[Service Workers & Caching](docs/Service-Workers-Caching.md)** — investigation: caching the WASM binary + app shell, the never-cache deny-list, and a phased PWA rollout.
- **[OpenRaster (.ora) Export/Import](docs/OpenRaster-Export-Import.md)** — layered `.ora` interchange: how export/import work and why the format was chosen. **Shipped.**
- **[Architecture Roadmap](docs/Architecture-Roadmap.md)** — the document-based-editor direction, prioritized and mapped onto the real repo (AppShell split, Zustand, workers, GPU).
- **[Entropy Report](docs/entropy-2026-07-30.md)** — dated structural-drift measurement: where AppShell actually is, whether the decompositions paid off, and what the hotspot list says.
- **[Content-Addressed GC Audit](docs/content-addressed-gc-audit.md)** — read-only reachability audit of everything in IndexedDB: what a collector would find, and the three orphan sources.
- **[Share-Links Auth Mismatch](docs/share-links-auth-mismatch.md)** — the two-Clerk-instance investigation, the prod auth verification, and the Stripe-linkage verdict.
- **[Security Hardening](docs/Security-Hardening.md)** — audit + roadmap: **the outstanding JWT key rotation**, share-token CSPRNG, the image-upload firewall, EXIF-by-default, and the supervised items (CSP, COEP, encryption).

- **Replicate** — AI image models (background removal, restore) via Convex

## The marketing site

`marketing/` — the five-page site at **[image-horse.vercel.app](https://image-horse.vercel.app/)**:
home, architecture, features, pricing, trail log. Vite + React 19 + react-router,
plain CSS off the tokens in `src/tokens.css` (no Tailwind, no UI library).
Vercel builds it via the root `vercel.json` — **don't delete that file**, it's what
points the deploy at `marketing/dist` instead of the app.

```bash
pnpm run dev:marketing      # local
pnpm run build:marketing    # production → marketing/dist
node marketing/scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs   # refresh the derived data (see below)
```

Its numbers are derived, never typed. `src/data/commits.ts` (the Trail Log's
commit squares) and `src/data/features.ts` come from `git log` and
`docs/Features.md` via `scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs` — **run it on every release**,
or the graph quietly keeps drawing last month. `src/data/releases.ts` is the
changelog itself, so that one is hand-written: add the new release at the top.

## Changelog

Latest release below. Full dated history → **[docs/Change-summary.md](docs/Change-summary.md)**.

### v7.61 — 2026-07-31

**Name a whole gallery from what's in the pictures.** Batch has a fourth tool:
AI Rename. It reads every loaded photo and names it from what it sees — the
dominant colour, whether it's bright or dark, whether it's a photograph, a
graphic or a screenshot, and a rough read on the subject. Scan once, then edit
the naming pattern and the whole list re-previews as you type.

It runs on your own machine, so it works signed out and costs nothing per
picture. And it describes a picture rather than recognising what's in it: you
get `dark-blue-portrait`, not `golden-retriever`. That's a real limit, and the
panel says so instead of pretending otherwise.

The reading happens in the engine. It samples a fixed grid whatever the
picture's size, so a 24-megapixel photo costs the same to look at as a
thumbnail.

**Drop or paste a stack of images and they go straight to the gallery.** The
three-way "where should this go" question only makes sense for a single
picture, so now it only shows up for a single picture.

That closed something worse. Dropping several images at once used to keep the
first one and throw the rest away — no message, nothing to say they'd gone.
Pasting several did the same. Both now take every image you hand them, as many
as your plan has room for, and say so when the batch had to be trimmed.

Two colours came out wrong and the tests caught it before release: pure blue
was being called "sky" and green foliage "lime", because the colour wheel was
labelled one notch off. Thirty-three new tests cover the naming, including the
case that matters most — twenty photos that honestly describe the same still
have to end up with twenty different filenames.
