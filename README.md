**Live:** [imagehorse.app](https://imagehorse.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Editor:** [edit.imagehorse.app](https://edit.imagehorse.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **batch editor** that works across a whole gallery in one pass — stamp a logo, apply text, bulk-rename by pattern, or name every photo from what is actually in it with a local describer that needs no account and no per-image cost.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

## Quick start

Needs Node + [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and the Rust toolchain plus
[`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) to build the engine.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build:wasm   # compile the Rust engine -> pkg/  (required before first run)
pnpm run dev          # editor at localhost:5173
```

`pnpm run build` bundles whatever is already in `pkg/` — it does **not** rebuild the
engine. After changing anything under `src/`, run `build:wasm` again, or use
`pnpm run build:all` to do both. A stale `pkg/` looks exactly like a broken feature.

Convex and Clerk are optional: with no keys set the app runs fully logged-out,
which is a supported path and not a degraded one. Full setup, deploy notes and
environment variables → **[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md)**.

## Documentation

- **[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md)** — install it, run the app and the marketing site, set up Convex, deploy.
- **[Architecture](docs/Architecture.md)** — how it fits together: layers and compositing, why one WASM binary, the Rust ↔ Convex bridge.
- **[File Map](docs/File-Map.md)** — where everything lives, in both the Rust crate (`src/`) and the React app (`app/src/`).
- **[Features](docs/Features.md)** — what it can actually do, end to end.
- **[Keyboard Shortcuts](docs/Keyboard-Shortcuts.md)** — every binding. The in-app modal (`Alt + /`) is authoritative for the tool digits; this mirrors it.
- **[OpenRaster (.ora)](docs/OpenRaster-Export-Import.md)** — layered interchange with Krita, GIMP and friends: how import/export work, and why this format.
- **[CI](docs/CI.md)** — the workflow jobs, the deploy sentinel, the static guardrails, and the local git hooks.
- **[Deploying](docs/Deploying.md)** — the two Vercel projects, the prerender step that makes the marketing site indexable, DNS, and the in-progress move of the editor off Netlify.
- **[Change Summary](docs/Change-summary.md)** — the full dated release history.

Design decisions live in **[docs/adr/](docs/adr/INDEX.md)**. Superseded investigations and planning notes are kept in **[docs/archive/](docs/archive/README.md)** rather than deleted — each one says what went stale about it.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust** — WASM processing layer (`wasm-bindgen`, `png` crate, `ab_glyph` fonts, SIMD128 kernels)
- **React 19** — UI framework (19.2.x, pinned through the pnpm catalog)
- **TypeScript** — Type safety
- **Zustand** — Client state management (UI / tool / gallery stores; IndexedDB-persisted prefs)
- **Vite** — Build tool with WASM support (`vite-plugin-wasm` + top-level await)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility styling via semantic design tokens; core utilities only, variants via cva
- **Radix UI** — Accessible primitives (Dialog, Tooltip, Context Menu)
- **Framer Motion** — Panel animations
- **Lucide React** — Icons
- **Sonner** — Toast notifications
- **emoji-mart** — Emoji picker (stamp tool)
- **JSZip** — Client-side ZIP (batch export)
- **IndexedDB** — Local-first storage (originals, edits, gallery); **Dexie** content layer + Zustand persist adapter
- **Convex** — Real-time database + auth + serverless functions
- **Clerk** — Authentication, wired to Convex through `ConvexProviderWithClerk` (`convex/react-clerk`)
- **Stripe** — Payments / billing, called over raw REST from Convex (no SDK dependency)
- **Replicate** — AI image models (background removal, restore) via Convex

## The marketing site

`marketing/` — the five-page site at **[imagehorse.app](https://imagehorse.app/)**:
home, architecture, features, pricing, trail log. Vite + React 19 + react-router,
plain CSS off the tokens in `src/tokens.css` (no Tailwind, no UI library).
Vercel builds it via the root `vercel.json` — **don't delete that file**, it's what
points the deploy at `marketing/dist` instead of the app.

```bash
pnpm run dev:marketing      # local
pnpm run build:marketing    # production → marketing/dist
node marketing/scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs   # refresh the derived data (see below)
```

Its numbers are derived, never typed. `src/data/commits.ts` (the Trail Log's
commit squares) and `src/data/features.ts` come from `git log` and
`docs/Features.md` via `scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs` — **run it on every release**,
or the graph quietly keeps drawing last month. `src/data/releases.ts` is the
changelog itself, so that one is hand-written: add the new release at the top.

## Changelog

Latest release below. Full dated history → **[docs/Change-summary.md](docs/Change-summary.md)**.

### v8.83 — 2026-09-22

**Mono and Serif survive a reload for real this time, and the site paints in half the time.**

v8.82 said a text keeps its typeface through a reload. It didn't. Pick
Liberation Mono, commit a text, reload, press Resume, and it came back in Sans.
v8.82 fixed where the typeface is stored, and that part was right — the text
still knew it was Mono. The loss happened one step later. The fonts only loaded
when you opened the Text panel, and a reload opens on Enhance, so the text was
redrawn before Mono existed and fell back to the built-in Sans. Exporting a
batch as a ZIP had the same problem.

The fonts now load before anything redraws your saved text, on every path that
does it. The wait is capped at four seconds, so a slow font can never stop a
photo from opening; the worst case is the old behavior. A font that fails to
download is tried again instead of being written off for the session. A browser
test now fails on v8.81 and on v8.82 and passes on this build.

The site's first paint is about twice as fast. On a phone, Lighthouse went from
64 to 97 and the largest paint from 6.4 s to 2.3 s. The fonts are served from
the site itself instead of from Google, every page loads only its own code, the
hero image has phone-sized copies, and the animated letters stop drawing once
you scroll past them.

There's a Contact page: email, bug reports, a private route for security
issues, and how to delete your account. No form — there is nothing on the other
end to receive one. The footer has three columns now, with a copyright line.

The tab icon is the horse on a rounded black square, on both sites, and the
home-screen icons finally match it. They were still a placeholder orange square.

The engine did not change. It is the same 814,432 bytes as v8.82.
