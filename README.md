**Live:** [rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app](https://rust-wasm-photo-tool.netlify.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **Batch Image Editor** for applying a logo to many photos in one pass, with a grid mosaic view of the gallery.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

## Changelog

Latest release below. Full dated history → **[docs/Change-summary.md](docs/Change-summary.md)**.

### v7.5 — 2026-07-02

Storage plumbing, invisible to use. Original photo bytes now read and write through a Dexie adapter instead of the hand-rolled IndexedDB `originalsStore`, using **lazy read-through migration**: the first time you open a photo that still lives in the old store, its bytes are copied into Dexie and served from there after — no bulk boot-time migration, no stall. The old database is never written or deleted, so it stays a clean rollback, and a single `USE_DEXIE_ORIGINALS` flag reverts everything. Verified against a real 12-photo gallery: every photo loads, only the ones you open get copied, the old store stays byte-identical. See [ADR-001](docs/adr/001-originals-lazy-migration-to-dexie.md).

> **About this release.** You won't notice anything — that's the point. First step of moving photo storage onto Dexie, done the careful way: existing photos keep working, migrate one at a time as you touch them, and the old copy stays put as a fallback until a future release retires it.

### v7.4 — 2026-07-02

The loading spinner never freezes now. It used to sit still under Reduced Motion — the OS setting or the in-app toggle — which reads as a hung app, because it rode the generic reduced-motion kill. Loading spinners are essential feedback (WCAG 2.3.3 exempts them), so the `Spinner` and the boot spinner keep turning for everyone; only *decorative* motion still stops. Under the hood, the settings-panel enter/exit animation that had been hand-copied into ~9 places is now one `settingsPanelMotion` export in the animation source of truth.

> **About this release.** If your spinner looked frozen, this is why — it was respecting Reduced Motion a little too literally. A stuck spinner tells you nothing, so it spins regardless now, while the app still drops the decorative motion. Plus a tidy-up: nine copy-pasted panel animations became one.
