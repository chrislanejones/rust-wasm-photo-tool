**Live:** [imagehorse.app](https://imagehorse.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Editor:** [edit.imagehorse.app](https://edit.imagehorse.app/) &nbsp;·&nbsp; [![CI](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chrislanejones/rust-wasm-photo-tool/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A browser-based image annotation and editing tool powered by **Rust/WASM** for pixel-level operations, **React + TypeScript** with **Zustand** state stores for the UI, and **Convex** for optional cloud persistence. Edits run locally in WebAssembly and your originals + edits live in the browser's **IndexedDB** — your pixels never leave the tab unless you sign in for persistence or AI features. Includes a **batch editor** that works across a whole gallery in one pass — stamp a logo, apply text, bulk-rename by pattern, or name every photo from what is actually in it with a local describer that needs no account and no per-image cost.

> Previously called **Clone Stamp App** — the app grew well beyond its origins as a single clone stamp tool.

## Quick start

Needs Node + [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and the Rust toolchain plus
[`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) to build the engine.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build:wasm   # compile the Rust engine -> pkg/  (required before first run)
pnpm run dev          # editor at localhost:5173
```

`pnpm run build` bundles whatever is already in `pkg/` — it does **not** rebuild the
engine. After changing anything under `src/`, run `build:wasm` again, or use
`pnpm run build:all` to do both. A stale `pkg/` looks exactly like a broken feature.

Convex and Clerk are optional: with no keys set the app runs fully logged-out,
which is a supported path and not a degraded one. Full setup, deploy notes and
environment variables → **[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md)**.

## Documentation

- **[Getting Started](docs/Getting-Started.md)** — install it, run the app and the marketing site, set up Convex, deploy.
- **[Architecture](docs/Architecture.md)** — how it fits together: layers and compositing, why one WASM binary, the Rust ↔ Convex bridge.
- **[File Map](docs/File-Map.md)** — where everything lives, in both the Rust crate (`src/`) and the React app (`app/src/`).
- **[Features](docs/Features.md)** — what it can actually do, end to end.
- **[Keyboard Shortcuts](docs/Keyboard-Shortcuts.md)** — every binding. The in-app modal (`Alt + /`) is authoritative for the tool digits; this mirrors it.
- **[OpenRaster (.ora)](docs/OpenRaster-Export-Import.md)** — layered interchange with Krita, GIMP and friends: how import/export work, and why this format.
- **[CI](docs/CI.md)** — the workflow jobs, the deploy sentinel, the static guardrails, and the local git hooks.
- **[Deploying](docs/Deploying.md)** — the two Vercel projects, the prerender step that makes the marketing site indexable, DNS, and the in-progress move of the editor off Netlify.
- **[Change Summary](docs/Change-summary.md)** — the full dated release history.

Design decisions live in **[docs/adr/](docs/adr/INDEX.md)**. Superseded investigations and planning notes are kept in **[docs/archive/](docs/archive/README.md)** rather than deleted — each one says what went stale about it.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust** — WASM processing layer (`wasm-bindgen`, `png` crate, `ab_glyph` fonts, SIMD128 kernels)
- **React 19** — UI framework (19.2.x, pinned through the pnpm catalog)
- **TypeScript** — Type safety
- **Zustand** — Client state management (UI / tool / gallery stores; IndexedDB-persisted prefs)
- **Vite** — Build tool with WASM support (`vite-plugin-wasm` + top-level await)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility styling via semantic design tokens; core utilities only, variants via cva
- **Radix UI** — Accessible primitives (Dialog, Tooltip, Context Menu)
- **Framer Motion** — Panel animations
- **Lucide React** — Icons
- **Sonner** — Toast notifications
- **emoji-mart** — Emoji picker (stamp tool)
- **JSZip** — Client-side ZIP (batch export)
- **IndexedDB** — Local-first storage (originals, edits, gallery); **Dexie** content layer + Zustand persist adapter
- **Convex** — Real-time database + auth + serverless functions
- **Clerk** — Authentication, wired to Convex through `ConvexProviderWithClerk` (`convex/react-clerk`)
- **Stripe** — Payments / billing, called over raw REST from Convex (no SDK dependency)
- **Replicate** — AI image models (background removal, restore) via Convex

## The marketing site

`marketing/` — the five-page site at **[imagehorse.app](https://imagehorse.app/)**:
home, architecture, features, pricing, trail log. Vite + React 19 + react-router,
plain CSS off the tokens in `src/tokens.css` (no Tailwind, no UI library).
Vercel builds it via the root `vercel.json` — **don't delete that file**, it's what
points the deploy at `marketing/dist` instead of the app.

```bash
pnpm run dev:marketing      # local
pnpm run build:marketing    # production → marketing/dist
node marketing/scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs   # refresh the derived data (see below)
```

Its numbers are derived, never typed. `src/data/commits.ts` (the Trail Log's
commit squares) and `src/data/features.ts` come from `git log` and
`docs/Features.md` via `scripts/gen-trail-data.mjs` — **run it on every release**,
or the graph quietly keeps drawing last month. `src/data/releases.ts` is the
changelog itself, so that one is hand-written: add the new release at the top.

## Changelog

Latest release below. Full dated history → **[docs/Change-summary.md](docs/Change-summary.md)**.

### v8.79 — 2026-09-16

**Perspective reaches everything you drew, Enhance gets Presets, and every dialog shares one backdrop.**

Point Perspective at a square, a circle, a line, an arrow, a pin, a pen path or
a piece of text and the warp happens to *that object*, not to the photo
underneath it. Text was the only thing that worked that way before; everything
else fell through to the pixel warp, so a square you had just drawn sat still
while the picture under it moved. The warped object stays an object — recolor
it, move it, drag it to a new size, undo it, or re-select it and adjust the same
corners. Apply, Reset and Cancel sit on the canvas under the box now, and Esc
takes the whole frame away.

Enhance has a Presets tile. One click applies a whole look, and hovering one
previews it on your own photo before you commit. A preset is a named stack of
adjustments the app already had, so applying it is a single undo step. The Quick
Adjust grid it grew out of is gone, and Adjustments is sliders only.

Every dialog has the same backdrop. Export, Settings, the Command Palette,
Diagnostics and Shortcuts had none at all while the New dialog had one, and the
rest had drifted to four different shades. The New dialog also opens without its
stutter — the backdrop used to re-blur the whole screen on every frame of the
animation.

The buttons at the bottom of Crop, Canvas Size, Layers, Levels, Color Picker
and Remove Object are one shape instead of four. In Rulers & Grid, clicking a
lit toggle now turns it off, where before clicking it again did nothing.

The Levels histogram is tall enough to read.

The New dialog has a switch. Off, which is the default, everything stays in your
browser. On adds Create AI Image, which sends your prompt to a server. It is
named for what it does rather than for AI, because it is where anything that
leaves your tab will live.

The site and the editor both run Google Analytics now.

The tab icon on imagehorse.app is the horse.
