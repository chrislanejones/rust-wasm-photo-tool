// November 2026: 26 entries across 10 releases,

// The headline numbers are ENTRIES and RELEASES, never the feature count. A
// month can ship more than the one before it and carry fewer `feature` tags —
// November did exactly that, because the work landed as infrastructure and
// fixes. Leading with features would have made the busiest month in the log
// read as the quietest.
